# Story framework

Don't just write logs, understand what's going on.

## What

A rule-based, contextual logging and telemetry framework for .NET.

## Why

In the traditional logging it's usually all about just dumping pieces of information along the way (of the code) and later trying to make sense of all that.

The problem with that is later making sense of that information.

We believe a new approach needs to be taken where these logs/telemetry and any important piece of information are stored in a context.
